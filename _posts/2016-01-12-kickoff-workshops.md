As Rhody R Stats is a new study group and we have yet to have a meeting, we've decided that a one day workshop would be a great way to kick things off and build a bit of momentum for the study group. During these workshops we will cover:

- R, RStudio, and Git installs
- Introduction to R
- Data Wrangling with R
- Data Visualization with R and ggplot2

**Instructor:** Jeff Hollister
**Helpers:** Looking for a 1-2 individuals who could serve as helpers (i.e. you are comfortable with the topics listed above) during the workshop. Add to this issue if you are interested in that.
**Dates:** Tuesday, January 12, 2016 and Wednesday, January 13, 2016

Info on registration and workshop website will be added here and on rhodyrstats.org when materials and registration gets finalized.
