<p>As Rhody R Stats is a new study group and we have yet to have a meeting, weâ€™ve decided that a one day workshop would be a great way to kick things off and build a bit of momentum for the study group. During these workshops we will cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>R, RStudio, and Git installs</li>
  <li>Introduction to R</li>
  <li>Data Wrangling with R</li>
  <li>Data Visualization with R and ggplot2</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Jeff Hollister
<strong>Helpers:</strong> Looking for a 1-2 individuals who could serve as helpers (i.e. you are comfortable with the topics listed above) during the workshop. Add to this issue if you are interested in that.
<strong>Dates:</strong> Tuesday, January 12, 2016 and Wednesday, January 13, 2016</p>

<p>Info on registration and workshop website will be added here and on rhodyrstats.org when materials and registration gets finalized.</p>
